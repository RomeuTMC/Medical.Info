Create a global repository of public data for people with allergies or chronic illnesses, in order to serve as a guidance for rescue services, contact details among others.
The purpose of this software is to create a public API where anyone can register medical data, contact information and biographies free and accessible through a QR CODE.
This QR CODE can be used to tag luggage or merchandise so that if it is lost it can be recovered by simply pointing the QR reader and opening the stored data.
The same QR can also be used to identify a person who suffers from some pathology and is unable to communicate with others by any method (such as people with mental confusion or other psychological disorders) simply by placing this code together with their personal documents or even using a tattoo somewhere on the body.
Patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes or allergies who may be unconscious for any reason can also tattoo or attach the QR CODE to their documents.
These are just some of the possibilities for using this API, which can be extended to other options. Adapted freely by any entity or expanded.
One of the premises is that it is accessible by any device capable of scanning a QR code with internet access, which is light and simple for all users, to perform the registration through the most diverse types of devices such as computers, cell phones, tablets and even smartwatches or others.
To obtain the data, we must be free of any proprietary solution, leaving the basic information in text, in the English language, and the possibility of more detailed information or in other languages ​​through a web address also linked by the same within the qr code.
